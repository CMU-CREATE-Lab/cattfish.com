            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Services.

The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these Terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other rights, so those provisions of these Terms may not apply to you.

The software embedded in the Product (and any updates thereto) ("Product Software") is licensed and governed by the <a href="/terms/eula">End User Licensing Agreement</a>. Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Services in connection with such features. All additional guidelines, terms, or rules, and the <a href="/terms/privacy-statement">Privacy Statement</a> ("Privacy Statement"), are incorporated by reference into these Terms and you are agreeing to accept and abide by them by using the Services.</li>

At any time, MellonHead may (i) suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Services, or (ii) terminate these Terms with respect to you if MellonHead in good faith believes that you have used the Services in violation of these Terms, including any incorporated guidelines, terms or rules. If you transfer a Product to a new owner, your right to use the Services with respect to that Product automatically terminates, and the new owner will have no right to use the Product or Services under your Account (as described below) and will need to register for a separate Account with MellonHead.</li>

You may not use another user's account without the express permission of the account holder. You agree to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account, and to maintain your password securely to prevent others from gaining access without your permission. You agree to immediately notify MellonHead of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your Account or any other breach of security.

            <li>
               Agreed Usage and Limitations Of MellonHead Services
               <ol type="a">
                  <li>Intended Use of MellonHead Services. The Services are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and control of MellonHead products. While we aim for the Services to be highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be reliable or available 100% of the time. The Services are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond MellonHead's control, including Wi-Fi intermittency, service provider uptime, mobile notifications and carriers, among others. You acknowledge these limitations and agree that MellonHead is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of the Services to reflect current status or notifications.</li>
                  <li>No Life-Safety or Critical Uses of the Services. You acknowledge that the Products and Services are not certified for emergency response. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE NOT A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM -- MELLONHEAD DOES NOT MONITOR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS AND WILL NOT DISPATCH EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES TO YOUR HOME IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. In addition, the MellonHead Customer Care and Support contacts cannot be considered a lifesaving solution for people at risk in the home, and they are no substitute for emergency services. All life threatening and emergency events should be directed to the appropriate response services.</li>
                  <li>Reliability of Notifications. You acknowledge that the Services, including remote access and mobile notifications, are not intended to be 100% reliable and 100% available. We cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive notifications in any given time or at all. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR CRITICAL PURPOSES. MOBILE NOTIFICATIONS REGARDING THE STATUS AND ALARMS ON YOUR MELLONHEAD PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY -- THEY ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. The information provided by MellonHead on what to do in an emergency is based on authoritative safety sources, but there is no way for MellonHead to provide specific information relating to a situation in your home. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to educate yourself on how to respond to an emergency and to respond according to the specifics of your situation.</li>
                  <li>Temporary Suspension. The Services may be suspended temporarily without notice for security reasons, system failure, maintenance and repair, or other circumstances. You agree that you will not be entitled to any refund or rebate for such suspensions. MellonHead does not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the Services.</li>
                  <li>System Requirements. The Services will not be accessible without: (i) a working Wi-Fi network in your home that is positioned to communicate reliably with the Products; (ii) an Account; (iii) mobile clients such as a supported phone or tablet (required from some functionality); (iv) always-on broadband Internet access in your home; and (v) other system elements that may be specified by MellonHead. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all required system elements and that they are compatible and properly configured. You acknowledge that the Services may not work as described when the requirements and compatibility have not been met.</li>
                  <li>Water Savings and other Benefits. Unless explicitly promising a "guarantee," MellonHead does not guarantee or promise any specific level of safety or other benefit from the use of the Products or Services or any feature of them. Actual water quality monetary benefits vary with factors beyond MellonHead's control or knowledge. From time to time, MellonHead may use the Services to provide you with information that is unique to you and your water usage and suggests an opportunity to save on your water bills if you adopt suggestions or features of the Product or Services. We do this to highlight an opportunity based on our analysis and information about you and your household. You acknowledge that these promotions are not a guarantee of actual savings, and you agree not to seek monetary or other remedies from MellonHead if your savings differ.</li>
                  <li>The Services provide you information ("Product Information") regarding the Products in your home and their connection with other products and services. All Product Information is provided "as is" and "as available". We cannot guarantee that it is correct or up to date. In cases where it is critical, accessing Product Information through the Services is not a substitute for direct access of the information in the home.</li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
               Limitations Of MellonHead Services Due to Third Parties
               <ol type="a">
                  <li>General. MellonHead Services rely on or interoperate with third party products and services. These third party products and services are beyond MellonHead's control, but their operation may impact or be impacted by the use and reliability of the MellonHead Services. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) the use and availability of the Services is dependent on third party product vendors and service providers, (ii) these third products and services may not operate in a reliable manner 100% of the time, and they may impact the way that the MellonHead Services operate, and (iii) MellonHead is not responsible for damages and losses due to the operation of these third party products and services.</li>
                  <li>Third Party Service Providers Used By MellonHead. You acknowledge that MellonHead uses third party services providers to enable some aspects of the Services -- such as, for example, data storage, synchronization, and communication through Amazon Web Services, and mobile device notifications through mobile operating system vendors and mobile carriers. YOU AGREE NOT TO RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR TIME-CRITICAL PURPOSES.</li>
                  <li>Equipment, ISP, and Carrier. You acknowledge that the availability of the Services is dependent on (i) your computer, mobile device, home wiring, home Wi-Fi network, and other related equipment ("Equipment"), (ii) your Internet service provider ("ISP"), and (iii) your mobile device carrier ("Carrier"). You acknowledge that you are responsible for all fees charged by your ISP and Carrier in connection with your use of the Services. You also acknowledge that you are responsible for compliance with all applicable agreements, terms of use/service, and other policies of your ISP and Carrier.</li>
                  <li>Third Party Products and Services that Work With MellonHead Services. MellonHead may provide the opportunity for you to interface to Third Party Products and Services. These Third Party Products and Services are not MellonHead products and services and you agree that MellonHead is not responsible for damages or loss that may be caused by them.</li>
                  <li>App Stores. You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Mobile Apps is dependent on the third party websites from which you download the Mobile Apps, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an "App Store"). You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and MellonHead and not with an App Store. Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading Mobile Apps from it. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Mobile Apps is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply.</li>
                  <li>Third Party Website Links and Referrals. The Site may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties ("Third Party Sites") and referrals to third party vendors ("Referred Vendors"). Such Third Party Sites and Referred Vendors are not under our control. MellonHead provides these links and referrals only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to such Third Party Sites or Referred Vendors. Your use of these Third Party Sites is at your own risk.</li>
                  <li>Release Regarding Third Parties. MellonHead is not responsible for third parties or their products and services, including the App Stores, Third Party Products and Services, Third Party Sites, Referred Vendors, Equipment, ISPs, and Carriers. You hereby release MellonHead and its licensors and suppliers from any past, present, and future claims, liabilities, and damages, known or unknown, arising out of or relating to your interactions with such third parties and their products and services. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."</li>

               Disputes and Arbitration
               <ol type="a">
                  <li>Contact MellonHead First. If a dispute arises between you and MellonHead, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns. You agree that you will notify MellonHead about any dispute you have with MellonHead regarding these Terms by MellonHead.</li>
                  <li>Binding Arbitration. You and MellonHead agree, subject to clause 11 (Protection of Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights), to submit any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services to binding arbitration rather than by filing any lawsuit in any forum other than set forth in this section. Further you agree arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. You also waive your right to any form of appeal, review or recourse to any court or other judicial authority, insofar as such waiver may be validly made. This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to your use of the Service. Subject to clause 11 (Protection of Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights), any dispute or claim made by you against us or us against you arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration except that you may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.</li>
                  <li>Arbitration Procedures. You must first present any claim or dispute to us by contacting MellonHead to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days after presenting the claim or dispute to MellonHead. MellonHead may request arbitration against you at any time after it has notified you of a claim or dispute in accordance with clause 11(f) (Notifications). The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the then current and applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association as modified by this agreement. The place of any arbitration will be Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, USA, and will be conducted in the English language. Claims will be heard by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or contrary to what this agreement provides, order consolidation or arbitration on a class wide or representative basis, award punitive or consequential damages or any other damages aside from the prevailing party's actual damages, or order injunctive or declaratory relief, except that the arbitrator may award on an individual basis damages required by statute and may order injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to an applicable consumer protection statute. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you, nor MellonHead nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement or appeal of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction. If any portion of this arbitration clause is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full force and effect.</li>
