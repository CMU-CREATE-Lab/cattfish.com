         <p>
            9. Limitations of Product Software
         </p>
         <p>
            You acknowledge that the Products and Product Software are not certified for "lab quality" analysis or water and environment. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT SOFTWARE ARE NOT A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM &mdash; MELLONHEAD LABS DOES NOT MONITOR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS AND WILL NOT NOTIFY EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES TO YOUR HOME IN THE EVENT OF AN WATER EMERGENCY.
         </p>
         <p>
            Unless explicitly promising a "guarantee," MellonHead Labs does not guarantee or promise any specific level of water quality or other monetary benefit from the use of the Products or Product Software or any feature of them. Actual water quality benefits vary with factors beyond MellonHead Labs' control or knowledge. From time to time, MellonHead Labs may use the Product Software to provide you with information that is unique to you and your water and suggests an opportunity to alert you about your water and adopt suggestions or features of the Product or Product Software. We do this to highlight an opportunity based on our analysis and information about you and your household. You acknowledge that these promotions are not a guarantee of actual water quality, and you agree not to seek monetary or other remedies from MellonHead Labs if your results differ.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Product Software provides you information ("Product Information") regarding the Products in your home and their connection with other products and services. All Product Information is provided "as is" and "as available". We cannot guarantee that it is correct or up to date. In cases where it is critical, accessing Product Information through the Product Software is not a substitute for direct access of the information in the home.
         </p>
         <p>
            10. Confidentiality.
         </p>
         <p>
            "Confidential Information" shall mean the Product Software and all other information disclosed to you that MellonHead Labs characterizes as confidential at the time of its disclosure either in writing or orally, except for information which you can demonstrate: (a) is previously rightfully known to you without restriction on disclosure; (b) is or becomes, from no act or failure to act on your part, generally known in the relevant industry or public domain; (c) is disclosed to you by a third party as a matter of right and without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by you without access to the Confidential Information. You shall use your best efforts to preserve and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information at all times, both during the term hereof and for a period of at least 3 years after termination of this EULA, provided, however, that any source code you receive shall be held in confidence in perpetuity. You shall not disclose, disseminate or otherwise publish or communicate Confidential Information to any person, firm, corporation or other third party without the prior written consent of MellonHead Labs. You shall not use any Confidential Information other than in the course of the activities permitted hereunder. You shall notify MellonHead Labs in writing immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this EULA, and will cooperate with MellonHead Labs in every reasonable way to regain possession of Confidential Information and prevent any further unauthorized use. If you are legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, then, prior to such disclosure, you will (i) immediately notify MellonHead Labs prior to such disclosure to allow MellonHead Labs an opportunity to contest the disclosure, (ii) assert the privileged and confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and (iii) cooperate fully with MellonHead Labs in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of such disclosure and/or use of the Confidential Information. In the event such protection is not obtained, you shall disclose the Confidential Information only to the extent necessary to comply with the applicable legal requirements.

         <p>
            13. Governing Law; Venue.
         </p>
         <p>
            This EULA, and any claim, dispute or controversy relating to this EULA, will be governed by the laws of Alleghney County, Pennsylvania, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction.

         </p>
         <p>
            14. Assignment.
         </p>
         <p>
            Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under this EULA are assignable by you, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and without effect.

            16. Severability.

         <p>
            17. Waiver.
         </p>
         <p>
            All waivers by MellonHead Labs will be effective only if in writing. Any waiver or failure by MellonHead Labs to enforce any provision of this EULA on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.
