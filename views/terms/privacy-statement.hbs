         <p class="question">
            What information does the MellonHead Sensor collect?
         </p>
         <p>
            The MellonHead Sensor collects:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Information input during setup</li>
            <li>Environmental data from the MellonHead Sensors.</li>
            <li>Direct water temperature/conductivity/quality from the device</li>
            <li>Water usage and other information, might be collected</li>
            <li>Technical information about your water, quality and quantity from the device</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            <span class="underline_and_italics">Information input during setup</span>: When you install the MellonHead Sensor, you'll be asked several questions about your home to help create an initial program of location and contact information. For example, we'll ask questions like, "Is MellonHead located in a home or business?". We'll also ask for your postal or zip code so that MellonHead can retrieve water information for your neighborhood. In addition, the MellonHead Sensor may pull information directly from your plumbing systems to learn basic information. Answering these questions helps us to set up an initial program.
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="underline_and_italics">Environmental data from the MellonHead Learning Sensor's sensors</span>: We collect data from several sensors built into the MellonHead Sensor. These sensors collect data such as current temperature, conductivity, and water flows. They can also sense other variables. By recording this information, the MellonHead Sensor can make you aware of basic water quality when you are/or not at home.
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="underline_and_italics">Water usage information</span>: Every time you flush your toilet the MellonHead Sensor may record the time and duration during which it was on in order to offer you added features.
         </p>
         <p>
            <span class="underline_and_italics">Technical information from the device</span>: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with the MellonHead Sensor, we record your MellonHead Sensor model and serial number, software version, and technical information such as battery charge level and any error codes.

         <p class="question">
            What information is shared among multiple connected MellonHead Products?
         </p>
         <p>
            If you have multiple MellonHead products interfacing with one another, the products will share certain information among one another, such as data on water and temperature.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            If a MellonHead Product interfaces to third party products and services, will information be shared?
         </p>
         <p>
            Over time, MellonHead may provide the opportunity for you to interface MellonHead Products to one or more third party products and services, which will involve the exchange of information from your MellonHead Product. Your explicit consent and authorization will be required for this interface, and will be revocable by you at any time.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            What additional information does MellonHead collect and store when a user connects a MellonHead Product to the Internet?
         </p>
         <p>
            To access your MellonHead Product over the Internet from a computer, a smartphone or a tablet, you will need to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. During setup, the MellonHead Product will ask for your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password to connect to the Internet. It will save this information on the device, along with your IP address, so that you can access it and control it from your computer, smartphone or tablet, and so that it can communicate with MellonHead servers and download software updates.
         </p>
         <p>
            Once connected to your Wi-Fi network, your MellonHead Product regularly uploads to MellonHead cloud servers the data mentioned above (excluding your Wi-Fi password) to provide you with the service.
         </p>
         <p>
            Additionally, when you create a MellonHead Account, we collect and store your email address. From that point forward, your email address is used for communications from MellonHead.
         </p>
         <p>
            Like most Internet sites, we routinely record log entries (including information such as your IP address) and technical information (such as your browser type and version) when your browser, mobile device or MellonHead Product contacts our servers. These log files are used for troubleshooting and are stored on our cloud servers.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            How does MellonHead use the information it collects?
         </p>
         <p>
            We use this information to provide and improve MellonHead Products and services, including information and recommendations about your energy use. We may use your email address to send you this information, or to ask you to participate in surveys about your MellonHead use. We use service providers to perform some of these functions. Those service providers are restricted from sharing your information for any other purpose.
         </p>
         <p>
            We use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to our cloud servers.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            With whom does MellonHead share my information?
         </p>
         <p>
            Under no circumstance do we share Personally Identifiable Information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the delivery of MellonHead Products and services without asking you first. Period. We do not rent or sell our customer lists.
         </p>
         <p>
            Our service technicians and other MellonHead employees have supervised access to your information so they can answer your questions if you contact us for help and so they can monitor our servers for technical problems.
         </p>
         <p>
            Except as described herein, we will only provide Personally Identifiable Information about our users to a third party if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
         </p>
         <p>
            We may share your aggregated and anonymous information in a variety of ways, including to publish trends about energy use and conservation, to help utilities provide demand-response services and to generally improve our system. We've taken steps to ensure that the information cannot be linked back to you and we require our partners to keep all information in its anonymous form.
         </p>
         <p>
            Your personal information may be collected, processed and stored by MellonHead or its service providers in the United States and other countries where our servers reside. As a result, your personal information may be subject to legal requirements, including lawful requirements to disclose personal information to government authorities, in those jurisdictions. If you select an outside party for the purchase, installation, or service of your MellonHead device and share your personal information, we cannot control the collection, storage or sharing of information collected by that party. For example, if you bought your Sensor from a retailer, they may collect personal information as part of the transaction. Or the party that installed the device may retain information that you provided to them to assist them in servicing the device if needed. Always check the privacy policies for any company that collects your personal information.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            How long does MellonHead save my personal information and how can I delete it?
         </p>
         <p>
            MellonHead stores your Personally Identifiable Information on MellonHead's cloud servers for as long as you remain a MellonHead customer in order to provide you with the service. As described above, some information is stored directly on the MellonHead device. All information is encrypted and cannot easily be accessed. You can delete the information on the MellonHead device by resetting it to the defaults (using Reset in the Settings menu).
         </p>
         <p>
            If you want to delete your Personally Identifiable Information from MellonHead's servers, please contact us at privacy@MellonHead.com. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after your information is deleted, backup copies may linger for some time before they are deleted.
         </p>
